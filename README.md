Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
Software engineering entails writing codes for computers, building apps,games and website, and solving real-world problem through technology through maintaining software systems
Important in ensuring high quality softwares/application, also important in debugging apps, built and maintain more advanced technologies that shape the world such as AI.

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
Artificial intelligence(AI) is a computer system that can perform that require human intelligence 
DevOps has been a milestone in the evolution of software engineering since it combines software development and IT operations that helps in improvement of software delivery. 
AI-assisted coding tools such as GitHub are used to enhance developer productivity and encourage non-programmers to develop applications

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
Planning.You identify the scope, objectives, risk and the feasibility structure of the software to be developed.
Requirement analysis. This phase gathers information from the user so that their needs can be met.
Design. Phase of creating the system architecture and software design.
Implementation. Writing of a code on the software based on the design specification.
Testing. Identify and fix bugs so that the software can effectively function.

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
Waterfall is best for structured projects, it is defined and completed one after another, rigid hence changes are difficult to implement, its testing is done at the end, best for large projects with a clear scope while Agile is best for dynamic and evolving softwares, has a continuous development cycle, it is highly flexible so changes can take place at any stage, requires a lot of feedback, testing is done throughout the process.
Waterfall will be appropriate in healthcare system or banking systems which are both structured projects
Agile will be appropriate in creation of new mobile apps where changes and customer feedbacks are required often


Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
The role of a software engineer is to design, code, and maintain the software application and is responsible of writting efficient codes, designing effective softwares and fixing bugs in the already existing software.
The role of a quality assurance engineer is to ensure the software meets the quality standards of the user needs before it is released and is responsible for designing test plans, identifying and tracking bugs as well as working together with developers to ensure issues concerning the softwares are resolved.
The role of a project manager is  to ensure the software development processes are done within the stipulated time and within a budget according to the requirements and is reponsible for defining the project spoce in terms of the time it should take and the budget and to to identify and solve some of the project risk involved.
Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
IDEs are software applications that are important in providing a comprehensive environment for writing, editing, debugging, and testing codes by helping speed up coding through suggesting syntax and early detection of errors and also offering debugging tools, and allow easy navigation across files and automatic code restructuring. Example is the Visual Studio Code. VCS is a tool important in tracking changes made to a code over time hence ensuring that multipe developers can colaborate efficiency while still maintaining the history of modification. When the changes are tracked, it makes it easier to revert to the previous version. Example of VCS is the Git used with GitHub.

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
A lot of time taken identifying and fixing bugs in large codebases. Can be overcomed by using debugging tools and built-in IDE debuggers.
Creation of poor quality codes that become difficult to make changes to them in future. Can be overcomed by reviewing the code on a regular basis and fixing bugs at early stages to avoid accumulations of the bugs.
Miscommunication between developers, quality assurance engineers and project managers can lead to misunderstandings. Can be overcome by incorporating collaboration tools such as Slack 

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
Unit testing is testing the individual components, function and modules of a program separately so as to ensure they work as expected individually. It is important in ensuring each unit functions correctly before integrating it with others making it easier to detect and fix bugs at the early development cycle.
Integration testing is when now the different components of an application are brought together to see if they work together as expected. It is important in ensuring a smooth communication between the different parts of the system.
System testing is now evaluating the entire application as a whole to ensure it meets the requirements. Its importance is that it verifies the complete system works as intended and ensures business and technical requirements are met.
Acceptance testing is done to determine whether the software meets business requirements and is ready for deployment. Its importance is that it ensures the software meets the user expectation and business needs.

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
Prompt engineering is communicating to AI by being clear, precise and curious so as to guide AI to generate accurate and relevant reponses. Its importance us that it improves the quality of the response generated by AI, can be used to write more effective codes and even effectively debug a code, AI can be made for specific tasks such as resume writing and it is also important in maximizing AI effectiveness.

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
What is biotechnology.
Explain what biotechnology is and include its definition, key applications in medicine, agriculture and industries, and how it has made an impact in the modern day society.
The second prompt is more effective since it is more specific on the areas I want to learn about Biotechnology, it provides context and it has a clear objective.
